A mod for the game ASCII Madness :)

This is a fan-made mod for the game ASCII Madness, by Bee Jackson! All copyright belongs to the original owner, ofc.

The mod includes three new mouse attacks, two non-mouse attacks that just make it a little harder to keep up in the game, three new powerups, a modification that gives the playable character a monocle on spawn, a mod that removes the EXIT attack (because, as the world's top professional ASCII Madness speedrunner, I can confirm that it's a pain in the ass to dodge and mostly RNG), and an implementation of the first attack of the Sans boss fight in Undertale with the built-in mouse attacks. That last one looks pretty awful, and in general there are plenty of bugs; active maintenance and all that.

There are two relevant files. The first, beeascii.py, doesn't actually access the modified game; it just brings up a menu, with a kind of cute auto-generated Christmas forest background. The second, beeascii3.py, does the proper game -- but with no style, just a text input. I have tried to get these to work together, but they don't seem to want to, and so they're staying separate for now.

In order to run beeascii3.py and play the game, you have to have ASCII Madness installed and in the same folder, under the name of asciiMadness_v1.py. You will also need the CMU Graphics library installed. Aside from that, setup is pretty intuitive - just click to run the game!

Merry Christmas :)
